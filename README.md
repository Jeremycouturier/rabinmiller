This project aims to generate big prime number using the Rabin-Miller primality test.

Integers are represented by the linked list of their digits, the head of the list being the least significant digit.

All the arithmetic functions needed to run the rabin-miller primality test are hand-coded by myself.

Each .c file is associated with a .h file which contains comments about what are the purposes of the functions defined in the .c file. The .c contain only fews comments.

liste.c contains functions who manipule linked list
arithmetique2.c contains functions who perform arithmetic operations on the linked lists.
rabinmiller.c contains the rabinmiller test in itself

By default, calculus are done in base 2327925600=2^5*3^2*5^2*7*11*13*17*19. In this base, a number terminating by 0 is divisible by all integer in [2,36]\{23,27,29,31}. This
allows to be more efficient than just checking every odd number. The expectancy of number of tries takes into account the fact that not all odd integers are tested, and is calculated from
the repartition of prime number.

The Rabin-Miller primality test is probabilistic. When it finds a number to be composite, then it is composite. And if every Miller witnesses tested are not witness for the compositeness of p,
then p is declared to be very probably prime. In this code, we use all primes from 2 to 61 as Miller witnesses (18 primes in total). The user can easily add more witnesses by slightly modifying
the function "est_premier" (is_prime) in the file rabinmiller.c. The probability of mistake quickly tends to 0 as the number of witnesses grows up.

To install, just download the whole project in any directory, go to that directory and use the make command (gcc must be installed).
The subsequent executable is called premier
